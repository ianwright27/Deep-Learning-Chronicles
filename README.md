### Deep Learning 


- This (Deep Learning Chronicles) repo is for deep learning research and experiments, beginner friendly neural networks to advanced applications that use mordern pre-trained models
- technologies used: tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, etc 
- hardware: Intel CPU, Intel GPU (Intel GPU experiments), Google Colab's T4 / T5x GPUs 


This README file will be updated frequently as the repo grows.
