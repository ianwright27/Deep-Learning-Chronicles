# Deep Learning Chronicles

A collection of deep learning research and experiments, ranging from beginner-friendly neural networks to advanced applications using modern pre-trained models.

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- **Hardware:** 
  - Intel CPU
  - Intel GPU (for Intel GPU experiments)
  - Google Colab (T4/T5x GPUs)

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository covers a spectrum of deep learning topics:
- Foundational neural network implementations
- Experiments with modern pre-trained models (fine-tuning)
- Hardware-specific optimizations and benchmarks

## 🚀 Getting Started
- **Software Requirements**
    - Python
    - Anaconda (with Jupyter Notebook)
- **or**
    - Google Colab 
- **if you like to live dangerously,**
    - Just write python scripts and run them too, as long as it works, right? 

## 📝 Note

This README is actively maintained and will be updated as the repository grows.
